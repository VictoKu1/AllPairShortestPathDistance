# All Pairs Shortest Path Distance

This repository contains a **highly optimized and readable Java implementation** of the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** for computing all-pairs shortest paths in a weighted graph, with additional support for vertex weights.

## Quick Start

```java
// Simple example: 4-vertex graph with vertex and edge weights
int[] vertexWeights = {1, 2, 3, 4};  // Cost to visit each vertex
int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
int[][] edgeWeights = {
    {0, 5, INF, 10},  // Edge from vertex 1 to others
    {5, 0, 3, INF},   // Edge from vertex 2 to others  
    {INF, 3, 0, 1},   // Edge from vertex 3 to others
    {10, INF, 1, 0}   // Edge from vertex 4 to others
};

AllDistances solver = new AllDistances(vertexWeights, edgeWeights);

// Get shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex 4
int distance = solver.getDistance(1, 4);  // Returns 15

// Get the actual path from vertex 1 to vertex 4
String path = solver.getPath(1, 4);  // Returns "1-4"
```

## What are Vertex Weights?

Unlike traditional shortest path algorithms that only consider **edge weights** (cost of traveling between vertices), this implementation also considers **vertex weights** (cost of visiting/stopping at vertices).

### Example:
- **Edge weight**: Cost to travel from city A to city B (fuel, toll, time)
- **Vertex weight**: Cost to visit city A (parking, accommodation, tourist fee)

### Total Path Cost Formula:
```
Total Cost = Sum of Edge Weights + Sum of Vertex Weights (excluding start vertex)
```

## Overview

The `AllDistances` class provides functionality to:
- Calculate the shortest distance between any pair of vertices in a graph
- Reconstruct the actual shortest path between any two vertices
- Handle both edge weights and vertex weights in the distance calculations
- **Ultra-optimized for maximum performance** with advanced algorithmic and micro-optimizations
- **Readable and maintainable code** with clear function/parameter names and detailed comments

## Code Clarity and Documentation

- **Descriptive function and variable names**: All methods and variables are named for clarity and intent.
- **Detailed comments**: Each method and important code block is explained with concise comments.
- **Maintainable structure**: The code is organized for easy understanding and future modification.
- **No testing or extraneous code**: Only production-ready logic is present.

## Algorithm Details

The implementation uses an **ultra-optimized and well-documented version** of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm that:

1. **Initializes** the distance matrix with edge weights
2. **Incorporates vertex weights** into the distance calculations
3. **Maintains a path matrix** for path reconstruction
4. **Computes all-pairs shortest paths** using dynamic programming
5. **Applies advanced performance optimizations** for maximum efficiency
6. **Is easy to read and maintain**

### Key Features

- **Vertex Weight Support**: Unlike standard Floyd-Warshall, this implementation considers vertex weights in addition to edge weights
- **Path Reconstruction**: Can reconstruct the actual shortest path between any two vertices
- **Symmetric Graph Handling**: Assumes undirected graphs (symmetric adjacency matrix)
- **Infinity Handling**: Uses `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2` to prevent overflow issues
- **Ultra-High Performance**: Multiple advanced optimizations for maximum efficiency
- **Readable and Well-Documented**: Designed for clarity and maintainability

### Performance Optimizations

- **Loop Unrolling**: For both initialization and main computation
- **Bit Manipulation**: Uses bit shifts for fast arithmetic
- **Cache-Friendly and SIMD-Friendly Access**: Optimized memory access patterns
- **Early Termination**: Stops when no improvements are possible
- **Connectivity Pre-computation**: Skips isolated vertices
- **Minimal Object Creation**: Pre-allocated buffers and efficient memory use
- **Overflow Prevention**: Uses `long` arithmetic and proper infinity handling

## Pseudocode

### Standard Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
```
function FloydWarshall(graph):
    let dist be a |V| × |V| array of minimum distances initialized to ∞
    let next be a |V| × |V| array of vertex indices initialized to null
    
    for each vertex v:
        dist[v][v] ← 0
    
    for each edge (u,v):
        dist[u][v] ← w(u,v)  // the weight of the edge (u,v)
        next[u][v] ← v
    
    for k from 1 to |V|:
        for i from 1 to |V|:
            for j from 1 to |V|:
                if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:
                    dist[i][j] ← dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
                    next[i][j] ← next[i][k]
    
    return dist, next
```

### Enhanced Floyd-Warshall with Vertex Weights
```
function FloydWarshallWithVertexWeights(graph, vertexWeights):
    let dist be a |V| × |V| array of minimum distances initialized to ∞
    let next be a |V| × |V| array of vertex indices initialized to null
    
    // Phase 1: Initialize with edge weights and apply vertex weights
    for each vertex i:
        for each vertex j:
            if i == j:
                next[i][j] ← i
                dist[i][j] ← 0
            else if edge(i,j) exists:
                next[i][j] ← j
                // Apply vertex weights: 2*edge_weight + vertex_weight_i + vertex_weight_j
                dist[i][j] ← 2 * w(i,j) + vertexWeights[i] + vertexWeights[j]
            else:
                next[i][j] ← null
                dist[i][j] ← ∞
    
    // Phase 2: Standard Floyd-Warshall with optimizations
    for k from 1 to |V|:
        // Skip if vertex k has no connections
        if vertex k is isolated:
            continue
            
        for i from 1 to |V|:
            if dist[i][k] == ∞:
                continue
                
            for j from 1 to |V|:
                if dist[k][j] == ∞:
                    continue
                    
                newDist ← dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
                if newDist < dist[i][j]:
                    dist[i][j] ← newDist
                    next[i][j] ← k
    
    // Phase 3: Final vertex weight adjustment
    for each vertex i:
        for each vertex j:
            if i ≠ j and dist[i][j] ≠ ∞:
                // Final adjustment: (dist + vertex_weight_i + vertex_weight_j) / 2
                dist[i][j] ← (dist[i][j] + vertexWeights[i] + vertexWeights[j]) / 2
    
    return dist, next
```

### Path Reconstruction
```
function ReconstructPath(next, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return [start]
    
    if next[start][end] == null:
        return []  // No path exists
    
    path ← [start]
    current ← start
    
    while current ≠ end:
        current ← next[current][end]
        if current == null:
            return []  // No path exists
        append current to path
    
    return path
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```java
// Create vertex weights array
int[] vertexWeights = {1, 2, 3, 4};

// Create edge weights matrix (adjacency matrix)
int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
int[][] edgeWeights = {
    {0, 5, INF, 10},
    {5, 0, 3, INF},
    {INF, 3, 0, 1},
    {10, INF, 1, 0}
};

// Initialize the algorithm
AllDistances allDistances = new AllDistances(vertexWeights, edgeWeights);

// Get shortest distance between vertices 1 and 4
int distance = allDistances.getDistance(1, 4);

// Get the shortest path between vertices 1 and 4
String path = allDistances.getPath(1, 4); // Returns "1-4"

// Get the complete distance matrix
int[][] distanceMatrix = allDistances.getDistanceMatrix();
```

### Advanced Example: Transportation Network
```java
// Cities with different costs (parking, accommodation, etc.)
int[] cityCosts = {10, 5, 15, 8, 12};  // Vertex weights

// Road distances between cities (INF = no direct road)
int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
int[][] roadDistances = {
    {0, 20, INF, 35, INF},  // City 1 connections
    {20, 0, 25, INF, 40},   // City 2 connections
    {INF, 25, 0, 15, 30},   // City 3 connections
    {35, INF, 15, 0, 18},   // City 4 connections
    {INF, 40, 30, 18, 0}    // City 5 connections
};

AllDistances network = new AllDistances(cityCosts, roadDistances);

// Find cheapest route from city 1 to city 5
int totalCost = network.getDistance(1, 5);
String route = network.getPath(1, 5);
System.out.println("Cheapest route: " + route + " (Cost: " + totalCost + ")");
```
